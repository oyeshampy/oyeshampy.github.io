# Puneet Sharma – Personal Engineering Site

This repository hosts my personal website, published using **GitHub Pages**.

The site provides a concise overview of my **professional background, technical focus, and engineering work**, with a strong emphasis on **production-grade backend systems and distributed architectures**.

🌐 **Live site:** https://www.puneetsharma.info

## About Me

I am a **Lead Software Engineer** with 13+ years of experience designing, building, and operating **reliable, scalable backend systems**.  
I currently lead the development of **business-critical CRM microservices** at **Check24 (Kredit), Germany**, running in high-traffic production environments.

My work combines hands-on engineering with technical leadership, focusing on long-term system ownership and operational stability.

## Technical Focus

- Java, Spring Boot, REST and API design  
- Production-grade microservices and service integration  
- Kubernetes, Docker, CI/CD in daily operations  
- Messaging systems (ActiveMQ, JMS)  
- Oracle, MySQL, Elasticsearch  
- Observability, JVM performance, and production reliability

## Site Content

The website is intentionally minimal and recruiter-friendly. It includes:

- Professional summary and technical focus  
- Experience highlights (Check24, adidas / Infosys)  
- Selected engineering work and projects  
- Links to GitHub, LinkedIn, and résumé (PDF)  

The goal is to communicate **technical scope, ownership, and seniority within 30 seconds**.

## Technology Stack (Site)

- HTML5, CSS3  
- JavaScript / TypeScript  
- Lightweight, performance-focused setup  
- Hosted via **GitHub Pages**

No frontend frameworks are used by design.

## Engineering Philosophy

Across both professional and personal work, I focus on:

- Clear, maintainable system design  
- Production readiness over experimentation  
- Observability, debuggability, and operational stability  
- Simple solutions to complex problems  

These principles are reflected in the site and the linked repositories.
